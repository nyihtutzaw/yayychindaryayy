After a long time of waiting, 21 years old boy from Dortmund have finally reached Theater of Dream. Sancho, our club's next generation, the next number 7 to be. He is there at last. Currenly he will wear number 25 and it is also a good choice. Because United has a curse of number 7 after King CR7 left the club and not giving this presure on the head of a young boy is a good choice. I'm really exited to watch a new season starting with a natural right winger. I really haven't watched Sancho ball playing because the first time I saw this guy on the field is he missing the penalty of Euro 2020 final. It sucks !!. Come on Sancho, leave it there, and win for united a trophy and more than one cups. We are hungry to eat these cups.
