In this article, I will describe the hunging out levels starting from my university life. Currently, I have a full time job and work on some part time projects. So, I will have find time and ways to hung out away from works currently and studies during student life. I have lots of closed friends and I mostly hung out with them. Most of the ways are

- Meeting at Our Favourite Tea Shop
- Travelling
- Going to Cinema

In the last two years, our level of hunging out is chaning repidly and I will describe these levels by depening upon the 4 things I metion above.
<br><br>
### Normal Life (Level 1)

##### 1. Meeting At Teashop

We have two or more our favourite tea shops around the city. We mostly meet after our office hour almost everyday. On Weekend, we call each other in the morning and spend time together at tea shop by eating everything we want. **We don't have to afraid of anything rather than the money in our pocket and our parents.**

##### 2 .Travelling

We have a kind of friend who is afraid of travelling because of not wanting to spend money. Out of this, we are okay to travel. Sometimes , big trip and mostly short trip to our favourite town near our city. **We don't have to afraid of anything rather than the money in our pocket,our parents and some of the jobs we might delay**

##### 3. Going to Cinema

I have took leave from job to watch MARVEL&DB movies at first day first show. It was the best part of my life. Booking the tickets, buying some food and relaxing in cinemas are the feelings I'm longing now.
<br><br>
### Life During Covid-19 First Wave (Level 2)

##### 1. Meeting At Teashop

When there came a paper annoucing the first positive case in our country, I called my friend and searched for tea shops around the city to meet each other because our favourite shops put the Close Sign on their door. There is no shop open. There are only a few people on the road.**We cannot meet each other. We just spend on Video Call together.We have to afraid of virus,our parents who doesn't want us to go out.**

##### 2 .Travelling

I just watched my old travelling photos and missed.
**There is no travelling. I had to spend about 2 months in home**

##### 3. Going to Cinema

As far as I noticed, the first thing that close because of Covid-19 is cinema. They closed before first positive case of the country.
**There is no cinema.Just netflix and chill lonely**
<br><br>
### Life During Post Covid-19 First Wave (Level 3)

##### 1. Meeting At Teashop

Our favourite shops are opening with a cover between each other. Sometimes, we sat together with a cover between us. Later we can remove that cover if shop's owner give permission.
**But we have to afraid of virus also and some shop owners who doen't allow to sit more than 2 people or more than 30min.**

##### 2 .Travelling

As far as I remember, we travel a short trip to the nearest town of our city. There is no restraction during travelling.
**So there is nothing to afraid. Parents allow us because we stayed at home about 2 months. Money is also okay.**

##### 3. Going to Cinema

The first thing closed is not opened yet. I missed so much.
**There is no cinema.Just netflix and chill lonely and discuss about movies and tv shows with friends when we meet each other**
<br><br>
### Life During Covid-19 Second Wave (Level 4)

##### 1. Meeting At Teashop

Tea shops closed again. At this time, we found out something to meet. We can go to a village with a steam. We bought tea and snack from the shops and spent time at that beautiful place. There are some tea shops that open without apporval. But we sat at that shops. And my friends rent a home and we spent time together there. The best memories. We spent Christmas, New Year and my birthday there. We also went to the shopping mall with the places to sit in there.
**In second wave, our afraid level is low because we became closed to virus. But I was afraid of my parents' who didn't want me to go out, some shop owners who doens't want us to sit a long time**

##### 2 .Travelling

There are restrictions to travel. So we didn't travel.
**We have to afraid of travel restractions**

##### 3. Going to Cinema

It is fk the same.
**There is no cinema.Just netflix and chill lonely and discuss about movies and tv shows with friends when we meet each other**

<br><br>
### Life During Post Covid-19 Second Wave (Level 5)

##### 1. Meeting At Teashop

We can meet each other at our favourite tea shops. One of the sad thing is some of the shops are closed according to economic crisis of Covid-19.
**I think there are nothing to afraid. I don't care about money this time**

##### 2 .Travelling

We took short trips with a paper that can overcome the restrictions of travelling on the road.
**I'm afriad that we have to come back on the road becasue restrictions doen't allow us to forward**

##### 3. Going to Cinema

No cinema open. But there is some hope because I heard cinema owners are disucssing to open again with good protections.
**I'm really missed the smell of the cinema**

<br><br>
### Life During Coup (Level 5)
##### 1. Meeting At Teashop

Tea shops opened. It is dangerous even to go outside. We try to meet each other around the dangerous things.
**We can be arrested or shot down on the road to teashop. We can also be done this things at tea shop or even our home during sitting or even sleeping**

##### 2 .Travelling

**Travelling is impossible during it is dangerous to go outside**

##### 3. Going to Cinema

No cinema open.Who can enjoy cinema in this kind of situation. Does it need to open cinema while celebraties being arreted?
**Just Netflix but sad,depress**
<br><br>
### Life During Coup & Covid third wave (Level 6)
##### 1. Meeting At Teashop
Shops are closed. It is dangerous to go to our favourite village because there is no security. We cannot meet each other at our friend's home. Because our friend move to another house with his relatives. It is not safe to stay alone at home in this situation. 
**We have to afraid of killers, thieves, thugs and devils who will arrest and shot us down**

##### 2 .Travelling
There are a lot of security on high way road. But they didn't give any protection to use. They just searched our vechicle, checked our condition. 
**It is not safe on high way road. I'm afraid of everything on the road**

##### 3. Going to Cinema

Sad news all over the media. Lot of people infected by Covid. We have to stay strong and healty. And also to stay safe.
**Just Netflix but sad,depress and afraid**

I mostly missed the times that I have freedom that I can go anywhere I want to go without the virus and killers. I always pray to get the days I have before rather than to get rich. I have to spend the best years of my age in home.
