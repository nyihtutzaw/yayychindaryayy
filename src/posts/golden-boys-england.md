### Before Euro2020
Because of Covid-19 crisis, Euro2020 cannot be hold in 2020 and moved to 2021. I'm a little far away from Football match before 2020 because I have no live broadcasting service to watch football match. I just follow the news and highlights in these last years. But in 2020, I got a way to watch Football games online and I watched many EPL games and also Champion League. I also watched Europa League becasue my favourite club is taking place in Europa League. As I mentioned, I mostly watch EPL matches and so I'm very exicted for England Nation Team that owns many talented young players and EPL superstar like Harry Kane. I support England since my childhood but they always with the ways that overrated Football team can lose. 

### During Euro2020
Since many games' times were midnight and I cannot watch all the games. I just watched the first game of each day (8:30pm) Myanmar time and sometimes second game (10:30pm) Myanmar time. It got very much close to EURO2020 becasue I watched games, news , predictions before game everyday from every bumeses channels. I supported England from their very first game against Croatia. It is really wired that Sterlin scored many games. I was so happy when England beat Germany becasue Germany is a very big giant for our favourite team since my childhood. 

### My Opinion about Final
I was really exicted and waited the day that the final will be hold. I did shopping for food to get up and watch that game at midnight. This is the second final of my favourite team in this year. I was also exicted for Europa League final and after the game I was unable to sleep. But I wished I was unable to sleep because I was so happy. But in reality , it didn't. So, in this final again, I didn't want to be like that. I was late to get up to watch the game and when I opened the game, it was 1-nil up for my team since 2 min. OMG!!. But in the end, my team lost by penalty. This is the second time of this year my team lost by penalty. I didn't know who to blame and cannot sleep again. But everybody knew it is because of the manager. He didn't do any tatical chanllenges to rivals. He just followd the flow of the game. In choosing penalty taker, he did mistakes. 19 years old boy kicked the final penalty and missed. I was really sad for all the players and especially for Jordan, the goalkeeper. The game has been ended and there is no time travel method to make England win. Football came to Rome instead of home. We have to wait another year for that. But I liked this team. I will support them in the next world cup and next euro competition. They are young players and I am waiting for them to hold cups and carry football to their home.
